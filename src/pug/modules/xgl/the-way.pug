        h3 Distribution
        p Ledgerium is a hybrid chain, where validators are chosen based on various factors. Of all possible validators, 20% will always be maintained by ledgerium. 40% will be given to top universities and public institutions, and the remaining 40% will be given to enterprises or the open market. This will ensure at all times, we have 60% of validators locked and producing blocks, no matter what the value of the token is.

        h3 Validators
        p Validators in the ledgerium ecosystem produce the blocks. Ledgerium will initially launch with only 20 validators and all other validators must be voted in. The requirements to be a validator are listed on our form. Once you apply our smart governance app will show your intent to product blocks to all other validators. At this point they will vote a new validator in. Validators can also be removed from the pool by other validators in the same way. For a validator to be added or removed, a consensus of over 51% is needed.
